    Kanchipuram is a Sanskrit word formed by combining two words "Kanchi" and "-puram" meaning "Brahma worship" and "residential place" respectively and located on the banks of the Vegavathy and Palar river. Kanchipuram has been ruled by the Pallavas, the Medieval Cholas,[3] the Later Cholas, the Later Pandyas, the Vijayanagara Empire, the Carnatic kingdom, and the British, who called the city "Conjeeveram".[3] The city's historical monuments include the Kailasanathar Temple and the Vaikunta Perumal Temple. Historically, Kanchipuram was a centre of education[4] and was known as the ghatikasthanam, or "place of learning".[5] The city was also a religious centre of advanced education for Jainism and Buddhism between the 1st and 5th centuries.[6]
